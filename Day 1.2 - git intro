## Murray's stats 2023

#### Split long script into smaller chunks

```{r}
summary(x)
```

you get a lot of commits over time and not all commits are equally important

### tag different commits

Lets you find important commits easier

add tag to current commit in terminal

**git tag -a "tag" -m "message"**

NB: cant have spaces in the tag but can have dots, message can have spaces and be long

keep tag short or it defeats purpose

Tag is searchable - message is not

can refer to commit by its number or its tag

### git - rolling back

**checkout**  - lets you see previous commit

in [terminal]{.underline}

**git checkout eb3a705f**  - goes back in time

Go forward in time again

Git checkout "tag"

Or can go to main
branch in drop down box

Git checkout main

Can use checkout to tag commit

**reset** - only do this for bank accounts or passwords - very destructive - destroys commit

**revert** - reverts back to previous commit - will make a file the same as file before

    git revert HEAD --no-edit

### Git - new branch 

can be used to explore different direction and then be merged back later if desired

also good for changed figures for publication but keeping code for thesis
