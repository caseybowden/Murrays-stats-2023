#### Split long script into smaller chunks

```{r}
summary(x)
```

you get a lot of commits over time and not all commits are equally important

### tag different commits

Lets you find important commits easier

add tag to current commit in terminal

**git tag -a "tag" -m "message"**

NB: cant have spaces in the tag but can have dots, message can have spaces and be long

keep tag short or it defeats purpose

Tag is searchable - message is not

can refer to commit by its number or its tag
